                <p>By day, I support investment advisors who use a software called Riskalyze to turn their clients into fearless investors. By night, I'm building skills as a web developer at Georgia Tech's coding boot camp. With whatever time is left, I like to blog about my experiences on Medium. <br> <br>
                When I'm not mastering customer support or web development, I enjoy the best empanadas you'll ever taste made by my lovely mother.        <br> <br> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
